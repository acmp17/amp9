    <p>class Calculator:
        """ This is the default result property"""
        result = 0

        def add(self, value_1):
        """ This is the add method"""
        self.result = self.result + value_1

    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>restrict access to methods and variables that are inside the class. Modifications from outside of the class
        cannot be made so to change the value we would have to use a setter function to take the value as a
        parameter. The self.result value is restricted only to modifications within the class as it is encapsulated.</p>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Creating a class for using details in another existing class without modifying it. The new formed class would be
        derived as a child class and the existing class as the parent class (base class). Method of the parent class is
        called inside the child class. The def add classes are derived child classes of the parent class "calculator"</p>
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Creating a common interface that takes any object and calls the objectâ€™s method. Each type can provide its own
        independent implementation of this interface.</p>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users can interact with the basic
        implementation, but the inner workings are hidden in order to reduce complexity. The base class of calculator
        did not need critical modifications, but the operation derived classes are what have the complex functionality </p>
