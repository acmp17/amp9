    <h1>All about Python/Flask</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Pytest</h2>
            <p>Pytest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using the Python programming language.
            It helps write simple and scalable tests kept in a file for a project. Flask is a web framework that provides useful
            tools and features that make creating web applications with Python much easier.</p>
        <h2>Outline</h2>
            <p>Project root folder (docker_flask) <- Root of the Project</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Venv folder <- a tool used to create isolated Python environments.
                    Contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.
                    Allows you to manage separate package installations for different projects.</li>
                <li>Tests folder <- contains python files that are testing features on the project affecting the workflow.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculator_test.py <- tests the calculator</li>
                        <li>Conftest.py <- makes the test configuration setup</li>
                        <li>Context_process_test.py <- testing approach depends on the context of the software developed.
                            Different types of software need to perform different types of testing</li>
                        <li>Docker_page_test.py <- tests the docker info page</li>
                        <li>Git_page_test.py <- tests the git info page</li>
                        <li>Simple_pages_test.py <- tests the elements of the home page</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>.dockerignore <- file that allows you to exclude files from context.
                    Helps build faster and lighter excluding big files that are not being used in the build.</li>
                <li>.gitignore <- same concept as .dockerignore where itâ€™s a file that allows you to exclude big files
                    that are not being used in the build from the git repository. </li>
                <li>.pylintrc <- static code checker that analyses the code without it actually running. checks for errors,
                    tries to enforce a coding standard, and tries to enforce a coding style.</li>
                <li>docker-compose.yml <- Orchestration file that contains the configuration to develop locally,
                    it overrides the Dockerfile to run the flask development server instead of running the gunicorn server that is used for hosting on Heroku</li>
                <li>Dockerfile <-File used to create an image to run in a container that runs the program</li>
                <li>Heroku.yml <- allows you to build docker images on Heroku and define it.</li>
                <li>Pytest.ini <- file that eases the difficulties in typing the same series of command line options every time you use pytest</li>
                <li>Readme.md <- a text file that is attached to a software program that contains critical or important information about that program.</li>

                <li>.github folder <- has information that is necessary for the project including and information on commits, remote repository address, a log on commit history. </li>
                <li>.coveragerc <- configuration files that control coverage.py. Checked into source control rather than home directory</li>
                <li>Workflows folder <- folder that combines several workflow tools into one application that automates processes involving machine and human tasks in a sequence
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dev.yml <- used for writing configuration files for the development portion of the project. Includes pytesting, heroku and docker connections</li>
